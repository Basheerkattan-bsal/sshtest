    <h1>Onkel BOB clean code</h1>
    <section class="s1">
        <p class="p1">Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to
            its knees.
            Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it
            doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
        <p class="p1">Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A
            Handbook of Agile
            Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best
            agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a
            software craftsman and make you a better programmer - but only if you work at it.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="s2">
        <p class="p2">The first 13 chapters, fully contained in the audio, describes the principles, patterns, and
            practices of
            writing clean code.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">The second part, chapters 14 to 16, consists of several case studies of increasing complexity and
            is included
            in a pdf that comes with your purchase. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code - of transforming
            a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. You’ll be reading code - lots of
            code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="s3">
        <p class="p3">The third part, chapter 17, is provided both in the audio and the pdf. It is the payoff: a single
            chapter
            containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a
            knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems
            analyst with
            an interest in producing better code.
